"This Python script implements a simple **movie recommendation system** using **Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. It begins by organizing user movie ratings into a **pivot table**, where rows represent users and columns represent movies. Missing ratings are estimated by applying **SVD**, reducing the data to a lower-dimensional representation. The predicted ratings are reconstructed using matrix multiplication and stored in a DataFrame. A recommendation function sorts these ratings and selects the top movies for a given user. When tested, it suggests the most relevant movies based on **predicted preferences**. This approach is a form of **collaborative filtering**, commonly used in real-world recommendation systems. "
